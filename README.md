## Tech Stack

- Golang 1.21
- PostgreSQL
- OpenAI

## Setup

1. Ensure your local PostgreSQL is disabled (or kill it manually), for instance:
   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 PID
   ```
2. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
3. Make sure you have filled in the credential or secret value in the .envrc file.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
5. You're all set!

## Manual Setup

1. Create a database called `assignment-amori` on PostgreSQL.
2. Set up PostgreSQL connection credentials to `postgres` as both the username and password.
3. Make sure you're already set the `.envrc` with your database configuration and the other variable.
4. Execute the command: `make run`.
5. You're done!

## Database Schema

There are 5 tables:

1. **Users**: `(id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, gender, gender_interest, phone_number, relationship_status, relationship_goal)`, with indexing on `phone_number`.
2. **Channels**: `(id, user_id, name)`, with indexing on `user_id`.
3. **Messages**: `(id, channel_id, sender_type, sender_id, content_type, content)`, with indexing on `channel_id`, `sender_id`, `content_type`.
4. **Message Inputs**: `(id, channel_id, source, sender, receiver, receiver_pronoun)`, with indexing on `channel_id`.
5. **Message Sources**: `(id, message_input_id, sender, content_type, content, sent_at)`, with indexing on `message_input_id`, `content_type`, `content`, `sent_at`.

## Libraries Used

- `gomock` for unit testing.
- `chi` for lightweight routing.
- `uuid` to generate unique strings based on time.
- `sonyflake` to generate unique numbers based on time.
- `pmx` as a driver for PostgreSQL.
- `httprest` for rate limiting.
- `makefile` for base setup.
- `openai` as a OpenAI SDK.

## Configuration

- Configuration is managed using a .envrc file format to define all layers of the application (DB, port, openai, etc.).

## Design Pattern

- The application uses the repository pattern to handle and separate code into various layers, including handler, usecase, and repository levels, which then interact with the database.
- The handler sanitizes the input, the usecase executes the main logic and returns data, and the repository manages data interactions with the datastore.

### Postman Collection

- Access the Postman collection [here](https://api.postman.com/collections/12053329-fddf68f9-bfb7-4a86-9ae5-2ed29c3bca83?access_key=PMAT-01J1FKPQX6BB0NKP90EA4N1CS6) to interact with the API's endpoints.


## Optimization Considerations

- Optimizations include implementing caching strategies to reduce database load, optimizing database queries to improve response times, and considering horizontal scaling to accommodate growth in user traffic and data volume.
- Utilizing Message Queues (MQ) can significantly enhance the efficiency of REST APIs by supporting an optimistic approach, eliminating the need to wait for a response from OpenAI.
- Improved prompting templates to enhance responses using conversation history.
